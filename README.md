Baggage Handler
================================

This is the Arduino sketch we used to write out accelerometer data to an SD card while it. It's a minor modification of the Datalogger example code from the Arduino IDE.

Our hardware rig was:
 
* An Arduino Uno
* An Ethernet shield because it had an SD card reader on it.
* An ADXL335 3-axis accelerometer. 

The output of the Z-axis of our first experiment with it onboard checked luggage looked like this:
